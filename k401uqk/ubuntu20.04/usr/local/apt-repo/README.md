# Local Apt Repository

Based on an old guide on Ubuntu wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal

Steps:

- Download the `.deb` file (make sure to download from a trusted source) and put it in the
  corresponding folder.

- Run `apt-update-local-repo` (either with `sudo` or as a root user).

- Run `apt-update`.
